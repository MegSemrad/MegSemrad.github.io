            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Prior to enrolling at Nashville Software School, I was pursuing an English Philology degree with a Celtic specialization in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland. 
               I chose this degree as it afforded me the opportunity to study foreign languages, which have always been an interest of mine. In having an 
               appreciation for languages, my interest was peaked upon hearing that developers utilized coding languages to build applications. Upon further 
               research, I became more and more excited at the prospect of having the opportunity to challenge myself to learn languages that were different 
               than anything I had encountered thus far and enrolled in NSS's Web Development Jumpstart. Since then, I have been drawn in not only by the 
               desire to better understand these languages but also the daily coding challenges and their accompanying rewarding feeling once overcome.</p>

            <h3>Health In One</h3>
            <p>Front-End Capstone:
                Health In One is an app which allows users to store in one place all of their relevant health data. Visiting your health care providers often 
                entails filling out paperwork and answer questions that require medical information one may find difficult to remember entirely. This app, 
                therefore, was designed to help minimize the risk of a patient walking into a health appointment unprepared. Additionally, this app may be 
                used to keep track of a user previous appointments.
